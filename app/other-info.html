                    <li>Be kind and courteous towards the individual.</li>
                    <li>Do not make judgmental statements or remarks to any of the individual's responses.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: You shouldn't feel that way; don't look at it like that; it’s not really that bad, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Do not feel the need to rush through the assessment.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide response time for the individual to share information.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Realize the response plan generated is a "good plan" but is not limited to the information provided. You may be able to create a personalized plan for that individual based on your relationship.
                    </li>
                    <li>Do not jeopardize your or another’s safety to intervene and assess.
                    	<ul>
                        	<li>Get help when help is needed.</li>
                        	<li>If you are concerned about someone’s wellbeing, do not leave the individual alone.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reach out to someone else that knows the individual for additional support.</li>
                    <li>Remember, just because an individual engages in self-injurious behaviors or self-harm doesn’t always mean that individual is attempting suicide.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Increased risk of suicide is higher when the individual has thoughts of doing it, a plan to do it, access to a means to do it, and the individual does not feel supported by family and friends. Other factors such as a history of abuse and
            
                            being bullied can also increase the chance of suicide.

                    </li>
                    <li>Realize the results in these reports are generalized and not 100% accurate.</li>
            
                    <li>Above all else, TRUST YOURSELF!
                        <ul>
                            <li>Listen to your instincts and be yourself. Empathy and compassion for the individual’s situation will show them that you care.</li>

                 These "signs" are guidelines for understanding how an individual may be at a higher risk of self-harm/suicide.<br /><br />

A single factor, or a combination of these signs can occur.<br /><br />
It is also important to understand the access to lethal means that an individual may have if they are experiencing a crisis.

                    <li><strong>For example:</strong> owning or the ability to easily get a gun, access to drugs and medications, razors, etc. <ul class="bullet-list">
