		<p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS."  YOU RELY ON THE SERVICES SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

		<p><span class="bullet">13</span> <b>Governing Law:</b> This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to any conflict of laws principles.</p>
		<p><span class="bullet">14</span> <b>Arbitration Agreement:</b> Except as provided herein, you and Company agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and Company relating to the Services or this Agreement (each a "<b>Claim</b>") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of JAMS ("<b>JAMS</b>"). If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an available alternative dispute resolution provider (“<b>ADR Provider</b>”) and the rules of such provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent <b class="highlight">jurisdiction</b>.</p>
		<p>For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, JAMS, you and Company must abide by the following rules:  (a) the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.  If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS rules, and the hearing (if any) will take place within 100 miles of your residence.</p>
		<p>If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive.  In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.</p>
		<p>This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Company also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and Company retain the right to apply to any court of competent <b class="highlight">jurisdiction</b> for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this Agreement, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Agreement. To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Company agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively in either a small claims court of competent <b class="highlight">jurisdiction</b> or the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles, California.</p>
		<p>Neither you nor Company may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim.  Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis.  The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Company's individual Claims.  The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.</p>
		<p>If any provision of this Section 14 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section 14 shall continue in full force and effect.  No waiver of any provision of this Section 14 will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.  Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Agreement.  This Section 14 will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</p>
		<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Company agrees that if it makes any future material change to this Section 14, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) of which you had already provided notice to Company.</p>
		<p><b>THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION OR TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM AND THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN JAMS RULES OR THE RULES OF AN ADR PROVIDER. </b></p>

		<p><b>Copyright Policy</b></p>
		<p>At ISD Innovations, Inc., we respect the copyright rights of others and have adopted the following procedure regarding the removal of allegedly infringing materials from any of our websites (“Website(s)”) and/or that appear via any of our applications (“Apps”), consistent with the removal notification and counter-notification provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable intellectual property laws.</p>
		<p>The DMCA provides a process for an owner of copyrighted material to notify an online service provider of alleged copyright infringement. Upon receipt of a valid DMCA removal notification (described below), we will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content and take reasonable steps to contact the party that originally posted that content to allow it to file a counter-notification that indicates that it had the right to post the content. Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification (also described below), we may restore the content in question, unless we receive timely notice from the party that requested removal that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity.</p>
		<p>By submitting either a removal notification or a counter-notification as described herein, the submitting party acknowledges and agrees that we may provide copies of such notices and any information contained therein to the other participants in the dispute or to any other third parties deemed necessary by us. Please note that federal law provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents: (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.</p>
		<p><b>Removal Notification</b></p>
		<p>If you believe someone has posted your copyrighted material on the Website or App and wish to have it removed, please send a removal notification to our designated copyright agent as provided below. To be considered valid, your request for removal must be written and include the following:</p>
		
        <ul class="bullet-list">
				<li><strong>1.</strong> A statement that you are the owner of the material that has allegedly been infringed, or a statement that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the material that has allegedly been infringed.</li>
				<li><strong>2.</strong> Your name, address, telephone number and, if available, an email address so that we may contact you.</li>
				<li><strong>3.</strong> A statement identifying the material that you believe to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate that material. (If you believe multiple copyrighted works have been infringed, you can submit a single notification with a representative list of the allegedly infringed works.)</li>
				<li><strong>4.</strong> A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
				<li><strong>5.</strong> A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the removal notification is accurate.</li>
				<li><strong>6.</strong> Your signature. (The signature may be electronic.)</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Promptly after receipt of a valid removal notification, we will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content. We will also notify the party that posted it of your claim that the material is infringing and will give that party an opportunity to send us a written counter-notification as provided below.</p>
		<p><b>Counter-Notification</b></p>
		<p>In response to our receipt of a valid removal notice and removal of material, if you believe that the allegedly infringing material is not infringing and want us to restore it on the Website or App, please send a counter-notification to our designated copyright agent as provided below.</p>
		<p>To be considered valid, your counter-notification must be written and include the following:</p>
		
        <ul class="bullet-list">
				<li><strong>1.</strong> Your name, address, telephone number and, if available, an email address so that we may contact you.</li>
				<li><strong>2.</strong> A statement identifying the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</li>
				<li><strong>3.</strong> A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material.</li>
				<li><strong>4.</strong> A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or for Los Angeles County, California, if your address is outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person who sent the removal notice or an agent of such person.</li>
				<li><strong>5.</strong> Your signature. (The signature may be electronic.)</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Promptly after receipt of a valid counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original removal notification. After we send out the counter-notification, the party that submitted the original removal notification must then notify us within 10 business days that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity. If we receive such notification, we will not restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material within 10 to 14 days of receipt of the valid counter-notification.</p>
